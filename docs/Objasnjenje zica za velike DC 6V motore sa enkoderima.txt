Red Wire - positive power supply of motor(+)(change positive and negative of motor the rotation will change)
White Wire - negative power supply of motor(-)(change positive and negative of motor the rotation will change))
Yellow Wire - signal feedback (motor one turn has 11 signals)
Green Wire - signal feedback (motor one turn has 11 signals)
Blue Wire - positive of encoder power supply(+)(3.3-5V),cannot be wrong
Black Wire - negative of encoder power supply(-)(3.3-5V),cannot be wrong

Potrosnja encoder-a je 12mA
Hall x Ratio 34.02 = 341.2PPR   


2. izvor:

Red → 	Motor Power + (exchange can control motor reversing)
Black → encoder Power - (positive and negative not take the wrong 3.3-5V)
Yellow → feedback signal   (11pulse/rpm)
Green → feedback signal   (11pulse/rpm)
Blue → 	encoder supply + (positive and negative not take the wrong 3.3-5V)  
White → Motor Power - (exchange can control motor reversing)
